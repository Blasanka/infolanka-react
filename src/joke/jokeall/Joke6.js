    return <p>A man was travelling in a bus, minding his own business, when the gorgeous woman sitting next to him started to breastfeed her baby.
    The baby wouldn't take it, so she said, "Come on sweetie, eat it all up or I'll have to give it to this nice man next to us."
    Five minutes later, the baby was still not feeding, so she said, "Come on, honey. Take it or I'll give it to this nice man here."
    Finally the anxious man blurted out, "Come on kid, make up your mind! I was supposed to get off four stops ago!"</p>;
