    return <p>Two blokes living in the Australian outback saw a couple of jobs advertised by the Queen of England. She was looking for footmen, to walk beside her carriage.
    They applied and were very happy to be flown to London for an interview with Her Majesty.
    She says to them: “Because my footmen must wear long white stockings, I must see your ankles to be sure they are not swollen or misshapen."
    After they show her their ankles, the Queen says: “It is also important that you don’t have knobby knees, so I need to see your knees too.”
    Once she has seen their knees, she says: “Now everything appears to be in shape, so I just need to see your testimonials.”
    Nine years later, when the pair are finally released from prison, one of the blokes says to the other:
    ”I reckon, if we just had a bit more education we would have got that job!"</p>;
