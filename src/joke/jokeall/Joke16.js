    return <p>Eleven people were hanging on a rope under a helicopter, ten men and one woman.
    The rope was not strong enough to carry them all, so they decided that one had to leave, because otherwise they were all going to fall.They were not able to name that person, until the woman held a very touching speech.
    She said that she will voluntarily let go off the rope, because as a woman she is used to give up everything for her husband and kids, or for men in general, without ever getting anything in return.
    As soon as she finished her speech, all men started clapping their hands.
    
    Send this to an intelligent woman, so that she has something to smile about today, and to those guys who you think can deal with reality.</p>;
