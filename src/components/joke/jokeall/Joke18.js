    return <p>Four worms and a lesson to be learned!!!!
    A minister decided that a visual demonstration would add emphasis to his Sunday sermon.
    Four worms were placed into four separate jars.
    The first worm was put into a container of alcohol.
    The second worm was put into a container of cigarette smoke.
    The third worm was put into a container of chocolate syrup.
    The fourth worm was put into a container of good clean soil.
    At the conclusion of the sermon, the Minister reported the following results:
    The first worm in alcohol . . . . . . Dead .
    The second worm in cigarette smoke . . . Dead .
    Third worm in chocolate syrup . . .. . Dead.
    Fourth worm in good clean soil . . . Alive â€¦
    So the Minister asked the congregation,
    "What did you learn from this demonstration?"
    Maxine was sitting in the back, quickly raised her hand and said . . .
    "As long as you drink, smoke and eat chocolate,
    you won't have worms!"
    That pretty much ended the service!</p>;
