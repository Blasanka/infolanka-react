    return <p>A sexy Irish blonde at a Casino, seemed a little intoxicated
    She bet 20,000 Euro on a single Roll of dice.
    She said - "I hope you don't mind, but I feel Luckier when I'm nude."
    With that, she removed her clothes, rolled the dice and yelled-"Come on baby, Mama needs new clothes!"
    As the Dice came to a stop, she jumped and yelled - "Yes, Yes,I Won.. I Won.."
    She hugged each dealer and picked up her winnings and clothes and left.
    The dealers gazed at each other, dumb founded. Finally, one of them asked-"What number rolled on the dice?"
    The other - "I don't know, I thought you were watching."
    Moral of the story:
    1.Not All drunks are Drunk,
    2.Not all Blondes are dumb,
    3.But all Men are Men!!!</p>;
